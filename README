Katana is a fork of the open-source project, Buildbot.  Find more information
at the Buildbot project website http://buildbot.net/

Unity Technologies sincerely thanks the Buildbot project for creating such a
fantastic continuous integration framework and for making it Open Source.
Without their work, Katana -- which powers the R&D team making the Unity game
engine and content creation tool -- would not exist.

Katana can be set up much like a normal Buildbot instance, but more detailed
instructions and examples are in-progress.

For now, start here: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/katana/wiki
